    <h2>Magnavox Odyssey (1972)</h2>
    <p>The Magnavox Odyssey was the world's first commercial home video game console. It was first demonstrated on May 24, 1972 and released in August of that year,
      pre-dating the Atari Pong home consoles by three years. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer who began around 1966 and had a working prototype finished by 1968.
      It was licenced and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972.
      The Magnavox Odyssey was a cartridge based console allowing it to play a different game simply by inserting a different game card.
      Although the console itself was black and white, color was added to the games by use of a screen overlay that attached to the screen of your CRT television.<br><a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1302004">Learn More</a></p>
    <h2>Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1990)</h2>
    <p>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea. The console
      introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of a variety of
      enhancement chips integrated in game cartridges to be competitive into the next generation. Approximately 49.1 million Super NES consoles were sold worldwide, with 23.35 million
      of those units sold in the Americas and 17.17 million in Japan. The console has retained a long-lived fan base and has continued to thrive on the second-hand market, emulators, and remakes.
      The SNES was the best-selling console of its era and is known as one of the greatest consoles of all time by many.<br><a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/24546/Super-Nintendo-Entertainment-System/">Learn More</a></p>
    <h2>PlayStation (1994)</h2>
    <p>The PlayStation, also known as the PS1, was a console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was the first console to sell over 100 million units. Before the PlayStation,
      The industry was dominated by SEGA and Nintendo. Instead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses
      four directional buttons. The success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. The increasing complexity of games, such as in
      content, graphics, and sound, pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers and caused the decision from sony to develop the console
      with CD-ROM instead of cartridges. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand.<br><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/PlayStation">Learn More</a></p>
    <h2>Wii (2006)</h2>
    <p>The Wii was released by Nintendo on November 19, 2006 and was a revolutionary console that brought a new perspective to gaming. It introduced the Wii Remote controller, a handheld pointing device
      and which detects movement in three dimensions. The console runs games supplied on Wii optical discs which are smaller than regular CDs. It also supported the WiiConnect24 service, which enabled Wii
      to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode. Like other seventh-generation consoles it supported a service, called "Virtual Console", that downloaded emulated games
      from past Nintendo consoles, support for online video streaming such as BBC iPlayer, and other services provided by Nintendo over the Internet. According to an interview with Nintendo game
      designer Shigeru Miyamoto, the concept of the involved focusing on a new form of player interaction.<br><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nintendo-Wii">Learn More</a></p>
    <h2>PS4</h2>
    <p>The PS4 was released by Sony in late 2013 and was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development, and
      for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. One of the most recognized changes between the PS3 and this console is the controller.
      The controller's motion tracking system is more sensitive than those of
      the PlayStation 3's controllers. An LED "light bar" was additionally added to the front of the controller; it is designed to allow the PlayStation Camera accessory to further track its motion, but can
      also be used to provide visual effects and feedback within games. A major addition to the DualShock 4 controller is its built in speaker and touchpad; it is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous touch
      presses, and can also be pressed down as a button. The PlayStation 4 has received very positive reviews by critics, praising the console's DualShock 4 design and social integration
      features.<br><a href="https://gizmodo.com/sony-ps4-everything-you-need-to-know-512462631">Learn More</a></p>
